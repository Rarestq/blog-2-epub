# Wait But Hi - Full Report

_原文链接: <https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/08/wait-hi-full-report.html>_

Last weekend (August 13th and 14th) was Wait But Hi—a global hangout weekend for Wait But Why readers.

It started with a survey we sent out to the WBW [email list](http://newsletter.waitbutwhy.com/join) in early July. Using what we learned from the surveys, our team spent a large part of the summer strategically matchmaking groups of people together and creating customized activities to fit each group.

Then, on Saturday, it all happened at once—over 3,500 people participated in over 400 events that took place in 168 cities, in these 48 countries:

And Sunday was big group day, with large picnic gatherings in cities all over the world.

It was exciting:

Other people—over 50—went on blind dates. (But people don’t tend to be into having a picture of them on a date posted on the internet so we’ll leave it at that.)

A bunch of people hosted hangouts in their homes. All over their homes. Like in the living room:

Empty tables turned into full tables:

There were rides:

And lots of games:

There was yodeling:

and Ws:

[![WBH16_Social086](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social086.png)](https://twitter.com/matthewjrogers/status/764452999183802374/photo/1)

And neighbors who were sick of your heady shit:

[![WBH16_Social084](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social084.png)](https://twitter.com/kaiticullerton/status/764732304673484800)

We made a few rules for everyone. One rule was that no one could talk or ask about anyone’s job for the first hour of the night.

[![WBH16_Social091](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social091.png)](https://twitter.com/LauraGlu/status/764574330617405440)

So people learned about each other in other ways. Like guessing which fun fact about their life was written by which person:

[![WBH16_Social092](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social092.png)](https://twitter.com/_ouisa/status/764719152875630592)

Or explaining why a certain random object defines you:

Or making a plan for if a shark ever bites you:

Another rule was that people had to bring a king of spades card to help identify each other. So there were kings:

Lots of kings.

Finally, we asked each group to make a stick drawing about their night. We didn’t specify much more than that—so things varied. A lot of groups drew the scene:

There were team efforts:

And solo projects:

[![WBH16_Social130](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social130.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJElP5sDWru/)

There were artists:

There were not artists:

There were bikes:

There were lobsters:

Some went artsy:

Some went Wait But Why-y:

And some blew my mind:

> There was a Vietnamese tea ceremony in Houston:

A slanty wine bottle in Poland:

And Tinder profiles in Hong Kong:

A bunch of groups depicted the great conversation:

About all kinds of things:

There were thought-provoking questions:

[![WBH16_Social147](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social147.png)](https://twitter.com/dougbrandon/status/764566669486424064/photo/1)

Controversial opinions:

[![WBH16_Social148](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social148.png)](https://twitter.com/rmancini08/status/764638945363845120/photo/1)

And pressing debates:

[![WBH16_Social149](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social149.png)](https://twitter.com/samsambamalam/status/764412476951703552/photo/1)

Some drawings revealed that things got weird:

[![WBH16_Social150](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social150.png)](https://twitter.com/AElegria/status/764592022254718976/photo/1)

And apparently some events didn’t go at all as planned. Like when these two militant Red Cross workers forced another attendee to donate blood:

[![WBH16_Social152](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social152.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDS1DID1b0/)

Or when these two chickens morphed into a person:

[![WBH16_Social153](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social153.png)](https://twitter.com/kavi_melb/status/764365152699330560/photo/1)

Or when these six people forced a baby to dump his things in a river:

[![WBH16_Social154](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social154.png)](https://twitter.com/toner_F/status/764551354266312704/photo/1)

Or when this happened:

[![WBH16_Social155](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social155.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJEmquMj2n0/)

And then there were some that are hard to describe. Like these solemn people underneath a large spoon holding a cherry:

[![WBH16_Social156](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social156.png)](https://twitter.com/fackelmann/status/764644055422758913/photo/1)

Or this zany man:

[![WBH16_Social157](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social157.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDXO_FjtDp/)

Or these four psychos:

Or whatever the fuck is happening here:

[![WBH16_Social159](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social159.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJFFKBqjEt-/)

But something the drawings did make clear is that a lot can happen in one night with a group of strangers:

[![WBH16_Social160](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social160.png)](https://twitter.com/VaNikolidakis/status/764568012393422850/photo/1)

Wait But Hi turned out to be a lot of things.

It was far from perfect. We were only able to set up events for 22% of the 16,000 people who applied. And there were mishaps—which people handled the best they could:

[![WBH16_Social161](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social161.png)](https://twitter.com/KevinGar77/status/764541164896649216/photo/1)

But mostly, Wait But Hi was full of good things.

Like laughter:

Fabulous conversation:

Unexpected fun:

And amazing strangers:

Who became friends:

The weekend was full of wonderful people:

[![WBH16_Social170](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social170.png)](https://twitter.com/raulmarcosl/status/764599458327920640)

Who made some souls grow more vibrant:

It was something like magic:

[![WBH16_Social172](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social172.png)](https://twitter.com/Pro_Ice/status/764584263069143040)

It was the internet in your living room:

[![WBH16_Social173](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social173.png)](https://twitter.com/janel_az/status/764573564259401728/photo/1)

Or for me and the WBW crew, it was the internet in Central Park:

[![WBH16_Social174](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social174.png)](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/765272445800615936/photo/1)

Which was a reminder that WBW readers are the best.

So thanks for throwing yourselves into our summer experiment—an experiment that taught us that we most definitely want to do more stuff like this.

Stay tuned.
