In case you missed it, here’s a transcript of the [first Trump-Biden Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cathmZFeXs&ab_channel=NBCNews):

**Chris Wallace:** Good evening. I’m Chris Wallace and I welcome you to what I predict will be a very bad personal experience for me. There will be six 15-minute segments, each on a different topic. At the beginning of each segment, both candidates will get two uninterrupted minutes to respond. The remainder of the segment will be open discussion. The audience has agreed not to be trashy. Both campaigns have signed off on these rules, so for sure nothing will go wrong. And with that, let’s welcome the candidates.

[CANDIDATES ENTER] 

**Wallace:** Let’s start with the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation to nominate someone to the court. Vice President Biden, you’ve called this an abuse of power. To start, why don’t you both explain your positions.

**Trump:** Amy Coney Barrett is a perfect nominee. Conservatives love her. Liberals love her. Chris Wallace loves her.

**Biden:** Amy Barrett would repeal the Affordable Care Act. And besides, the new thing is that you have to wait until after the election to nominate someone.

**Trump:** Not sure what you’re talking about, because last I checked a presidential term is four years, not three. You want to instate Communist medicine.

**Biden:** I don’t want to instate Communist medicine. I want to expand Obamacare.

**Trump:** Your party wants to instate Communist medicine, and you’re scared of them.

**Biden:** I may be scared of them but I _am_ the Democrat Party now, so even if I was and still am scared of them, I’m not anymore. They’ll do what I say now. And how about Covid? The president killed 200,000 people. Roe v. Wade.

**Trump:** You would have killed 2 million people by not banning China. Not Roe v. Wade.

**Wallace:** K let’s go back to healthcare for a minute. Mr. President, over the past four years you have promised to replace and repeal Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up—

**Trump:** Yes I have.

**Wallace:** with a plan—

**Trump:** Of course I have.

**Wallace:** to—

**Trump:** Of course I have.

**Wallace:** replace—

**Trump:** I got rid of the individual mandate.

**Wallace:** Oba—

**Trump:** The individual mandate was a joke.

**Wallace:** macare.

**Trump:** The individual mandate was the worst part of Obamacare.

**Wallace:** I am the moder—

**Trump:** The individual mandate sucks dick.

**Wallace:** I AM THE MODERATOR of this debate and I would like to be treated as such. You have never come up with a plan to replace Obamacare. So what is the Trump healthcare plan?

**Trump:** I’m cutting drug prices. Insulin is like water.

**Wallace:** Uh huh. How about you Joe? Why do you want to end private insurance?

**Biden:** I don’t want to end private insurance.

**Trump:** You’re literally friends with Bernie Sanders.

**Biden:** No I’m not. I want to—

**Trump:** You’re a piece of shit Joe.

**Biden:** I want to make sure—

**Trump:** A sad little man.

**Wallace:** Stop picking on Joe, Mr. President.

**Trump:** You care deeply about Bernie Sanders. You like Communist medicine. Anyway I asked the doctors and they said Obamacare is a disaster.

**Biden:** He doesn’t have a plan.

**Wallace:** Changing gears, Joe some of your colleagues are talking about ending the filibuster and packing the court. What’s your stance on that?

**Biden:** My stance is that voting is good. Americans should vote. It’s easy. You just go to the polling place, you wait in line, and then you go into the booth, and you push the little switch down for the candidate you want to vote for. Sometimes it’s not a switch.

**Trump:** You gonna pack the court, Joe? Tell us about how you’re gonna pack the court, Joe. The radical Left is pulling your puppet strings Joe. You and I both know it Joe.

**Biden:** Shut up, man.

**Wallace:** This is going well. Okay next segment. Covid-19. There have been more than 7 million cases in the United States and more than 200,000 have died. The question is, why should people trust you more than your opponent to handle this public health crisis?

**Biden:** 40,000 people a day contracting Covid. 200,000 people dead. He has no plan. He knew in February. He lied. He panicked. He complimented China. He has no plan. He’s playing golf.

**Trump:** I saved lives. It’s China’s fault. You wanted to let Chinese people come here. Dr. Fauci and all the Democrat governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” And they’re not the only ones. All of the other people said it too. “President Trump did a phenomenal job,” they all said. I did a phenomenal job. The gowns, the masks, the ventilators, you don’t know how to make a ventilator, the vaccine is here, any week now. You could never have done the job I did because you’re a random old man. You couldn’t even do swine flu. Swine flu is a disaster.

**Biden:** He panicked. People died. And more people are gonna die unless he gets a lot smarter—

**Trump:** Did you just use the word smart? You lied about going to college at Delaware State. You were the worst student at Delaware State. You’re a dumb fuck Joe. I know it. Chris Wallace knows it don’t you Chris.

**Wallace:**

**Trump:**

**Biden:**

**Wallace:** Mr. President, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks. Are you not in favor of masks?

**Trump:** Masks are tremendous. I have a mask right here in my pocket. I wear masks when needed. Masks have said I’ve done a phenomenal job. Joe wears masks even when it makes no sense. He wears them when he’s 200 feet away from me. He wears a mask when he’s sleeping.

**Wallace:** Mr. Vice President, is that true?

**Biden:** If you wanna open a business, you gotta have a plan.

**Wallace:** Sir, I was asking about masks.

**Biden:** Oh masks? Sure, you gotta have a mask.

**Wallace:** Alright next segment. The economy. Mr. Trump, you go first.

**Trump:** It’s a big dick economy.

**Biden:** No.

**Wallace:** Okay how about taxes. Mr. President, apparently you pay $750 a year in taxes. There’s a girl my daughter knows who’s 15 and she works in a movie theater on Sundays and sells the candy. And she pays more than $750 a year in taxes. So is this true, Mr. President? How much did you pay in taxes in 2016 and 2017?

**Trump:** Miyyons.

**Wallace:** Miyyons, sir?

**Trump:** Miyyons and Biyyons. I don’t pay taxes because the Obama administration said I didn’t have to.

**Wallace:** Joe, what’s your plan for taxes?

**Biden:** I’m gonna build this economy. I’m gonna make jobs. We’re gonna buy American. We’re gonna buy American ships. American steel. American buildings. We handed him a booming economy and he blew it.

**Wallace:** But did you actually hand him a booming economy and did he actually blow it?

**Biden:** Sure, whatever. He talks about the art of the deal. China has perfected the art of the steal.

**Trump:** China buttered your son’s belly.

**Biden:** China did no such thing.

**Trump:** And then, Joe? You know what happened after that? Your son went to Moscow. And you know what happened there Joe? Moscow buttered your son’s belly.

**Biden:** Nothing happened there.

**Trump:** Sure did Joe. The mayor of Moscow’s wife. She buttered his belly slick.

**Biden:** You wanna talk about families Trump? How about your family. With their grease and their shoes. It’s not about families. It’s about the American people. It’s about families.

**Trump:** Oh and how about Ukraine?

**Wallace:** You know what? Time to move on to—

**Trump:** Ukraine buttered the shit out of—

**Wallace:** Mr. President.

**Trump:** Ukraine buttered him up real good.

**Wallace:** Mr. _President_.

**Trump:** Shut your mouth Chris. What about Ukraine Joe?

**Wallace:** VAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH

**Trump:**

**Wallace:** Now I’m gonna say something and I want you to listen right to me, Mr. President. I have had it up to here with you. Any more misbehaving and I will put you in timeout.

**Trump:** And you know what else—

**Wallace:** I will put you _right in timeout_ , Mr. President. And then you’ll be sorry. Now I want you to stop being a bad boy, is that clear?

**Trump:** How about him? He should get timeout too.

**Wallace:** Well frankly, Mr. President, you’ve been the badder boy.

**Trump:** He’s been plenty bad.

**Wallace:** For the next segment, we’ll be talking about race. Why should voters trust you to deal with the race issues facing this country? Mr. Vice President, we’ll start with you.

**Biden:** I’m all for race. It’s about equity. About equality. About equanimity. Equilibrium. Equinox. We need to fix the systemic equity of racism and fragility in this country. And this president has done none of that. He wants to fix the systemic equity of the Nazis.

**Trump:** The blacks love me. Everyone knows that the blacks love me. I have blacks come up to me on the street all the time and tell me they love me. Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and I have done more for the blacks than Joe could ever dream of. Joe won’t say law enforcement. Why won’t you say it Joe? Why are you such a puppet Joe? You’re the radical Left’s toy. You’re a yo-yo. The radical Left won’t let you say law enforcement because they bounce you like a yo-yo, Joe.

**Wallace:** I want to turn to the subject of protests. In many cities, things have turned violent. Portland, for instance, is a certifiable madhouse. Mr. Biden, have you ever called the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon and been like, “wtf?”

**Biden:** I don’t have their numbers. Otherwise I would have. Do you have their numbers Chris? If you do, text them to me. And besides, they’re taking care of things just fine.

**Trump:** Yeah Joe? They’re fine? They’re literally murdering people in the streets, which is a disaster, and no one in Portland cares.

**Wallace:** Mr. President do you like or not like white supremacists?

**Trump:** No of course not. I don’t not like, or don’t not not like any of the people.

**Wallace:**

**Trump:**

**Wallace:** Mr. President, what is your message to white supremacists?

**Trump:** Get your guns but don’t fire till I give the word. Anyway the Left is committing 99% of the violence right now.

**Biden:** Oh baloney. Antifa is an idea, not an organization. I heard it means anti-fascist, in which case heck, sign me up. And anyhow who hasn’t thrown urine at an old lady on a bad day? The Antifas are just like you and me.

**Wallace:** I’m having an awful time here. I’m really upset and I want to leave and I’m having a bad, bad time. For the next segment, let’s just go with “why should you be president over your opponent?”

**Trump:** There has never been a leader who has done more than I’ve done. And I don’t mean just U.S. presidents. Mandela. Attila the Hun. Caesar. King Tut. None of them did as much as I’ve done. I unified this country. For the first time in U.S. history, I ended division. I have the first 100% approval rating. And how about judges. I have 300 judges. I have judges up the ass, Chris. You know why? Because Obama and crazy Uncle Joe forgot to fill the seats. Who does that. No one does that. You forget your keys, sure I’ve forgotten my keys, I’m human, we all forget our keys, sometimes I leave my keys. But leaving judges is a disaster.

**Biden:** This man has made the country weaker, sicker, poorer, fatter, sloppier, and slipperier. When I was Vice President I went head-to-head with Putin, but Trump is Putin’s little puppy. His cuddle-bunny. His bushy-bushy-boo-boo.

**Trump:** At least Putin’s not my sugar daddy, like he is to your son.

**Biden:** K speaking of that, fuck off. Second, you talk about the military being losers—my son was in Iraq and he was no loser, he was a patriot.

**Trump:** Which son, the loser or the dead one?

**Biden:**

**Wallace:**

**Trump:** I don’t know the dead one, but if I recall, the loser got thrown out of the military, dishonorably discharged for having a nice time with his cocaine, only to then head off on his famous belly-buttering tour.

**Biden:** His belly is dry!

**Wallace:** Oh for fuck’s sake. Let’s move on to climate change. Mr. President, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what is your plan to confront it?

**Trump:** I want clean water and air. As far as the California fires are concerned, the forest floors are full of dead trees and leaves.

**Wallace:** Okay but what do you believe about the science of climate change?

**Trump:** I want clean water and air. I’ve planted a biyyon trees. We’ve got to pick the leaves up in the forest in California. Every year I get the call. California’s burning again. Because again they didn’t pick up the fucking leaves. You know in Europe, they pick up leaves.

**Wallace:** Joe?

**Biden:** I want to get rid of fossil fuel plants and invest in renewable energy. I want to transition to electric cars and make green buildings and create millions of new jobs.

**Trump:** He’s talking about the Green New Deal. The 55 quadrillion dollar Green New Deal.

**Biden:** The Green New Deal is a plan that’ll pay for itself. It’ll work great.

**Wallace:** Do you support the Green New Deal?

**Biden:** Of course not. I’m talking about the Biden Plan. Who said anything about the Green New Deal?

**Wallace:** Mercifully, we’ve reached the final segment of my extremely awful night. Election integrity. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election?

**Biden:** There is no evidence that mail-in ballots are problematic. Trump is trying to convince people not to vote. Listen to me America. Get out there and vote. If I get enough votes, this whole thing is over and the bad man can’t hurt you. It doesn’t matter what he says, if I get enough votes he’s legit not in power anymore, how rad is that.

**Wallace:** Mr. President?

**Trump:** A squirrel’s ass, Chris. That’s where someone found a ballot the other day. A squirrel shit out a ballot in a park in Philadelphia and a man picked it up and guess what? It said Trump on the ballot. Big shocker there. This is what happens with mail-in ballots. They end up in a trash can in a river in the woods in the backcountry and then eventually the trash can gets caught up in an eddy, we both know how eddies work Chris, and it washes up on the bank, and then a squirrel gets into it and eats the ballots. Half the country’s ballots have already been found in eddies and in squirrels, and all of them were votes for me. Mail-in ballots are a fraud.

**Wallace:** One thing we all know for sure is that this election is going to be a shitshow. Will you accept the results of the shitshow and tell your supporters to accept the results peacefully?

**Trump:** If there’s no fraud, yes.

**Wallace:** Is there any foreseeable outcome where you lose and you don’t say it’s fraud?

**Trump:** No. I’ve already talked about the squirrels. If I lose, we’ll need to end the country.

**Wallace:** Biden?

**Biden:** The country can go on if I lose.

**Wallace:** And that concludes what will end up as a stain on my career even though it clearly wasn’t my fault. Thank you, and goodnight.
