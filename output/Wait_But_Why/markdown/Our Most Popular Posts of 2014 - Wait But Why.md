_The gargantuan SpaceX post is coming soon. In the meantime, here’s our 2014 end-of-year post with the year’s most popular posts._

Every year, the last few days of December are full of every site aggressively reviewing the year for us. It’s time to reflect, whether you like it or not.

Well fuck it—we’re a website, and it’s time to join the coercive reflection party.

2014 was a fun year for us at Wait But Why—we explored a bunch of new kinds of topics, took our first crack at making a [store](http://store.waitbutwhy.com/), launched a new way for readers to interact with the [Dinner Table](https://waitbutwhy.com/table), and the summer travel [series](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/odd-things-odd-places-7-travel-posts.html) was definitely a thing that was a thing. On the personal side, my New Year’s resolution a year ago was “Next year, Tuesday means _Tuesday_ ” and then I proceeded to post on time between 0 and 2 times. Exciting year all around.

We posted a bunch of large and small things throughout the year on different parts of the site—but at the core were 35 big, long posts (you can find all of them in the [Archive](https://waitbutwhy.com/archive)). So which of them did best?
