# Odd Things in Odd Places - All 7 Travel Posts - Wait But Why

_原文链接: <https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/odd-things-odd-places-7-travel-posts.html>_

Welcome to the Odd Things in Odd Places series.

In May of 2014, I polled Wait But Why email subscribers about which countries they’d like to send me to over the summer. They decided to amuse themselves and chose Russia, Japan, Nigeria, Iraq, and Greenland. So I went to each of them, consecutively, for about half a month each, and after each place, I wrote a big post about the country and what I learned there. There were seven posts in total, which are all linked below. Enjoy!
